IMDB Movies Sentiment Analysis üé¨üîç
Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of unseen movie reviews.

Problem Statement
Movie reviews are an important factor in influencing audience decisions.
Automatically detecting the sentiment behind these reviews helps companies, platforms, and users understand public opinion better.

Dataset
Source: IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset

Features: Textual movie reviews

Labels: Sentiment (Positive or Negative)

Approach
Data preprocessing (cleaning text, removing stopwords, etc.)

Text vectorization using TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words

Model building using classifiers like:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines

Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used
Python üêç

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Google Colab (for development)

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook and run all the cells.

Results
Achieved a high accuracy score (you can fill in the exact value after your model training) on test data, indicating that the model can reliably classify movie review sentiments.

Future Improvements
Try deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for even better performance.

Expand the dataset for better generalization.

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
